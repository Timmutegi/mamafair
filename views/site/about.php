        Mama Fair is a solution to ensure that every child celebrates their fifth birthday 
        According to statistics, 45 out of 1000 children die before the age of five maily due to communicable diseases that can be 
        prevented when immunization schedules are followed strictly.
        As Mama Fair, we have a number of solutions to ensure that parents can have useful information
        during the pre and post natal period. This infromation ranges from personal hygiene, diet and general
        questions that people ask. Credible information is essential in child upbringing.
        <p> We also provide modern immunization charts that parents can use to track the immuniation schedules of 
        their young ones as well as get notifications prior to the immunization day of children. Majortiy of children
        miss immunization due to ignorance or their guardians forget their immunization dates.Children who do not et immunizations are
        at the risk of getting diseases.</p>
      
        <p>MamaFair also connects parents to doctors who can advise on child related problems. This is because
        a lot of time is spent in queus in hospitals due to a shortage of doctors . Instead of going to hospital,
        MamaFair will prevent long queus in hospital by getting your concerns addressed at the comfort of your home.
